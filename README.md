# ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier from Scratch (Iris Dataset)

This repository contains a simple, educational implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** built entirely from **scratch using NumPy** â€” no machine learning libraries used (except for loading and splitting the dataset with scikit-learn).

The classifier is trained on the classic **Iris dataset**, and uses **Entropy** and **Information Gain** to recursively build decision rules for classifying iris flowers.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- âœ… Entropy and Information Gain calculation  
- âœ… Threshold-based splitting for continuous features  
- âœ… Recursive tree building with early stopping (pure node or max depth)  
- âœ… Predictions for single and multiple samples  
- âœ… Accuracy evaluation on test set  
- âœ… Only uses NumPy (besides dataset loading)

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

The [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is used, which includes:

- 150 samples of iris flowers  
- 4 numerical features:  
  - Sepal length  
  - Sepal width  
  - Petal length  
  - Petal width  
- 3 target classes:  
  - Setosa (0)  
  - Versicolor (1)  
  - Virginica (2)
